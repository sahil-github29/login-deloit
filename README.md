## User Login / Register App

## Just clone the app and then run these commands one by one

1. npm i
2. npm start
3. go to /server and run "npm start" to start the API server

## The feature I have used

1. Routing
2. Joi Form validation
3. Proper components destructuring
4. Saving form data and displaying using APIs is implemented.
